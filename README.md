## Portfolio 
Responsive website made with use of SASS, CSS3, HTML5, JQuery and PHP.  
Contains an intro page, vertical or horizontal timeline, projects and contact page.  
A set of vector icons found on the main page can be found in the assets/icons/lang folder together with the svg file.

## Basic SASS
### Install compass by running 
```gem install compass```
### Install css_parser running 
```gem install css_parser```
### Create test app 
```compass create sass-test```
### Complile sass to css
Compile from the root of a directory that has the config.rb file and two folders, one containing the sass files, the other containing the stylesheets. Run ```compass watch``` before making any changes to the sass files. Compass will watch and compile as you save your changes.
### *PHP warning*
The PHP on the contact page is currently not functional on the website because of some dependency issues with azure cloud services.
